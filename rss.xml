It's January 15, and today's image comes to us from Playa Grande, Mexico.</p> <p>I realize that some readers may be tiring of seeing the Milky Way Galaxy, but not me! I love photos of our galaxy and so they are regularly featured in the Daily Telescope. However, this photo is truly special, as it highlights not just the heavens above, but one of the wonders here on Earth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995815#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995815&comments=1">Comments</a></p> ]]>

    <![CDATA[ Lines keep blurring between work and play screens, and OLED overwhelms. ]]>

    <![CDATA[ <div id="rss-wrap"> <figure class="intro-image intro-left"> <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dell-800x600.jpg" alt="Dell UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW)"> <p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dell-scaled.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="1920" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span class="sep">/</span> Dell's upcoming UltraSharp U4025QW. (credit: Scharon Harding)</p> </figure> <div><a name="page-1"></a></div> <p>Each year, the Consumer Electronics show brings a ton of new computer monitor announcements, and it's often difficult to figure out what's worth paying attention to. When it comes to the most interesting models this year, there were two noteworthy themes.</p> <p>First of all, my complaint in 2022 about there <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/oled-monitor-selection-is-pathetic-2023-can-change-that/">not being enough OLED monitors</a> was largely addressed this year. CES revealed many plans for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/why-oled-monitor-burn-in-isnt-a-huge-problem-anymore/">OLED monitors</a> in 2024, with a good number of those screens set to be appropriately sized for desktops. That includes the introduction of 32-inch, non-curved <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1704738600">QD-OLED options</a> and other smaller screens for people who have been waiting for OLED monitors in more varied form factors.</p> <p>Secondly, with more people blending their work and home lives these days, CES brought hints that the line between gaming monitors and premium monitors used for general or even professional purposes will be blurring more in the future. We're not at the point where the best productivity monitor and ideal gaming monitor perfectly align in a single product. But this week's announcements have me imagining ways that future monitors could better serve users with serious work <em>and</em> play interests.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995280#p3">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995280&comments=1">Comments</a></p> ]]>

It suggests someone who is backward-looking, averse to progress, afraid of new technology, and frankly, not that bright. But Brian Merchant claims that that is not who the Luddites were at all. They were organized, articulate in their demands, very much understood how factory owners were using machinery to supplant them, and highly targeted in their destruction of that machinery.</p> <p>Their pitiable reputation is the result of a deliberate smear campaign by elites in their own time who (successfully, as it turned out) tried to discredit their coherent and justified movement. In his book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/brian-merchant/blood-in-the-machine/9780316487740/?lens=little-brown"><i>Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech</i></a>, Merchant memorializes the Luddites not as the hapless dolts with their heads in the sand that they’ve become synonymous with, but rather as the first labor organizers. Longing for the halcyon days of yore when we were more in touch with nature isn’t Luddism, Merchant writes; that’s pastoralism—totally different thing.</p> <h2>OG Luddites</h2> <p>Weavers used to work at home, using hand-powered looms (i.e., machines). The whole family pitched in to make cloth; they worked on their own schedules and spent their leisure time and meals together. Master weavers apprenticed for seven years to learn their trade. It worked this way in the north of England for hundreds of years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995716#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995716&comments=1">Comments</a></p> ]]>

In the first instance, US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/judge-wont-force-reddit-to-identify-anonymous-users-who-discussed-piracy/">ruled</a> in the US District Court for the Northern District of California that the First Amendment right to anonymous speech meant Reddit didn’t have to disclose the names, email addresses, and other account registration information for nine Reddit users. Film companies, including Bodyguard Productions and Millennium Media, had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/reddit-should-have-to-identify-users-who-discussed-piracy-film-studios-tell-court/">subpoenaed Reddit</a> in relation to a copyright infringement <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.480117/gov.uscourts.njd.480117.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> against Astound Broadband-owned RCN about subscribers allegedly pirating 34 movie titles, including <em>Hellboy </em>(2019),<em> Rambo V: Last Blood</em>, and <em>Tesla.</em></p> <p>In the second instance, the same companies sued Astound Broadband-owned ISP Grande, again for alleged copyright infringement occurring over the ISP’s network. The studios subpoenaed Reddit for user account information, including "IP address registration and logs from 1/1/2016 to present, name, email address, and other account registration information” for six Reddit users, per a July 2023 <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.414273/gov.uscourts.cand.414273.15.0.pdf">court filing</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995738#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995738&comments=1">Comments</a></p> ]]>
